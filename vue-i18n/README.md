# vue-i18n

```bash
npm install vue-i18n@next
# OR
yarn add vue-i18n@next
```

This example includes adding global translations and single file component translations.

**Note:** A wrapper composable is used to ensure ease of change when the `@nuxtjs/i18n` module is updated to work with Nuxt 3, only one file will then *hopefully* need to be changed.
